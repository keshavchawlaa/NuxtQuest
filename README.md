# Introduction

    This repository is a personal practice project where Iâ€™m experimenting with various concepts in web and app development using Laravel and Nuxt.js. The project started with basic functionality like creating a student form, viewing a list of students, and adding features like editing, deleting, and searching records.

    Each day, I aim to add new, random features and improve my understanding of full-stack development by integrating different tools and techniques. This could range from UI/UX enhancements to backend optimizations or adding advanced features like authentication, APIs, and more.

## Technologies Used:

- **`Frontend`** : Nuxt.js (Vue.js)
- **`Backend`** : Laravel (PHP)
- **`Database`** : MySQL
- **`Other`** :Axios, Bootstrap


*Feel free to contribute, suggest improvements, or check out my progress as I continue to grow my skills and learn new things!*# NuxtQuest
